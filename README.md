# Twitter profile card
### Responsive twitter profile card with data using API


Go to [apps.twitter.com](https://apps.twitter.com/) and get yourself the following:

   `oauth_access_token`
   
   `oauth_access_token_secret`
   
   `consumer_key`
   
   `consumer_secret`
   
   Put them into `functions.php` lines `24-27` (replacing the placeholder XXX).
   
   Now to call a profile card browse to `index.php?username=X` with X being the twitter username you want to get a profile card for.
